Rethink db structure
	- Save date based on how it will be read
		- Define project/public

Search Project
	- onkeyup delay 500ms && > 2 chr
	- trigger search
	- search DB, trigger search_result
	- feed result to <list> module
	- feed list item to <item-project> module

Project X
	- Create views (dashboard, new ring, old ring, rings, users)
	- Project Dashboard includes:
		- Project info (editable for owner)
		- Statistics
		- Ring series (editable for members)
		- Users (owner only)
